    <p>
      I have led and contributed to multiple interdisciplinary projects funded by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), and the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT). These projects span areas such as human-autonomy teaming, digital twins, wearable sensing, and construction safety. This section highlights a selection of those projects.
